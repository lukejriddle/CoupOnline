# CoupOnline
This project is based on the card game [Coup](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/131357/coup). I was inspired to work on this project during the COVID-19 quarantine in early 2020 so that my friends and I could continue to play regularly.

## Technologies
This project was made using Node.js, Express.js, and socket.io.

The front-end was made using React.js.

## Lobbies
Lobbie names are generated with a random combination of an adjective and a noun. Other players can enter the lobby name and join. Once all players are ready, the game will begin.

## The Game
The game fully supports all of the rules of traditional Coup (no expansion packs are supported at this time). Upon ending a game, they players can opt to play again.

## To Add
Cookie support that allows rejoining a game which a player has left.
